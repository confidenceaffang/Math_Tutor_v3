Description: A simple silly math tutor program. It asks the user for their name,
has an enum for the different math types, gives the user 3 attempts max for each round
it also increase the range of questions being asked by a constant value of 10 when levelling up.
If the person gets 3 correct the person moves the next level and increases the range but if the person
gets 3 incorrect the person moves down a level if the person is currently at a level greater than 1.
After 3 attempts the program asks the user if they wish to continue and does continue and if they say no
it terminates the program.
