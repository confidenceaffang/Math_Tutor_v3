Description: A simple silly math tutor program. It asks the user for their name,
has an enum for the different math types, gives the user 3 attempts max for each round
it also increase the range of questions being asked by a constant value of 10 when levelling up.
If the person gets 3 correct the person moves the next level and increases the range but if the person
gets 3 incorrect the person moves down a level if the person is currently at a level greater than 1.
After 3 attempts the program asks the user if they wish to continue and does continue and if they say no
it terminates the program. It also has a 2 vectoe components that actually store the questions asked,
the attempts, the correct answer and the level and also displays the summary report of the total questions
asked, the total correct, total incorrect and the average correct answers which is rounded to the nearest integer
